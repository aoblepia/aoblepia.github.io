At GM, I worked in the Electrical Integration Lab at the Global Tech Center in Detroit, MI.

The lab tests hardware and software combinations for the various GM brands and trim levels for quality assurance and regulatory purposes.

Some of my daily responsibilities included working with system bench engineers to develop embedded systems to test various hardware features like startup voltage and current for ICE vehicles.

I developed a custom ECM patch panel design that would allow technicians to quickly validate individual pin status for 70% cheaper than the previous solution.
My main project at General Motors was developing an automation and remote access solution for the various CAN devices that are present in every GM vehicle (like airbags, ECMs, and audio features). In a testing environment, these devices must be enabled, bypassed (signals are routed around them) or disabled. Previously, this was controlled by a a manual switchboard. My task was to create a way to automate this. I created a network of microcontroller-based boards that were inserted in series with the switchboards, allowing both remote access and manual hand control just in case.

This was an awesome experience and I loved exploring Detroit and meeting the other interns from all over the world!
