I conducted weekly recitations to teach 50+ students practical applications of Arduino microcontrollers, breadboards/circuit modeling, and basic IC components. 

I also organized and led weekly review sessions to help students with problem sets regarding circuit design, C/C++ programming, basic digital signal processing through MATLAB, and CMOS logic gates.

This class was one of the reasons I chose to study electrical engineering. I really liked the hands-on hardware aspect and learning the theory behind all of the cool connected devices.
