At Burns & McDonnell, I worked within the 1898 & Co. global practice in the Utility Consulting division in Kansas City, MO.

1898 & Co. analyzes the transmission and distribution systems of utilities across the nation, identifies key leverage points, and recommends specific upgrades.

Some of my daily responsibilities included working with consultants, analysts, and clients to help make these recommendations. I was able to quickly adapt to the industry's software analysis tools like CYME and WindMIL to simulate steady state and transient seasonal grid load simulations for various clients.

My main project was developing an internal procedure to leverage these softwares and create a framework for the Distributed Energy Resource (DER) studies that 1898 frequently performed. This framework significantly reduced the onboarding time for new employees, since I had recognized frequent pain points and documented general processes.
