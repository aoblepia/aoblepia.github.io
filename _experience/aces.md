This semester I'm helping out at Notre Dame's EE study room. This room provides undergraduates mentoring opportunities and allows them to make connections with upperclassmen, both for schoolwork help and for career advice.

The classes covered by the room this year are:

- EE 20100: Introduction to EE (sophomore level)
- CSE 20133: Introduction to Computing for EE Majors (sophomore level)
- EE 30122: System Theory and Application (junior level)
- EE 30152: Applications of Electromagnetics (junior level)
