I am an undergraduate researcher in the Snider Group at Notre Dame. I support an adiabatic computing project which aims to drastically reduce CPU power consumption.

I am working with the team to implement a ramping clocking board. This involves schematic creation with Fusion/Eagle and PCB assembly, both by hand and with a pick-and-place.
