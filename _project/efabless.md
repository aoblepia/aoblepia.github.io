I was able to participate with a group of my classmates in Efabless Corporation's Open Shuttle Program, and our group was fortunate enough to have our design chosen to be fabricated!

Here's a link to our project: [https://platform.efabless.com/projects/2680](https://platform.efabless.com/projects/2680)

We designed an 8-bit parity checker in Verilog with a controller and datapath. Our design passed MPW and tapeout, and the Efabless team chose our project and 39 others from across the world to be produced on the GFMPW1 shuttle!

This was a really exciting experience where I got to learn about the process from a logical design to code to layout to production.!
