I created a high gain amplifier using an RF double stub matching network @1GHz for an AT-41485 transistor. 

I was able to perform stability and gain analysis. This project earned the Keysight RF & Microwave Level 1 certification since I got to work with ADS, LineCalc, and other RF design and analysis tools.
