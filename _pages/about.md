Hi, I'm Aidan, an electrical engineering student at Notre Dame. Iâ€™m passionate about creating effective solutions in the workplace, on design teams, and in my own life. I'm interested in robotics, consumer hardware, cars, space, and embedded systems. I love leading teams and solving problems in creative ways.

## Updates

After a great summer in Seattle with SpaceX Starlink, I will be completing my final year in Electrical Engineering at Notre Dame!
