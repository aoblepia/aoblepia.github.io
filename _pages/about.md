Hi, I'm Aidan, an electrical engineering student at Notre Dame. Iâ€™m passionate about creating effective solutions in the workplace, on design teams, and in my own life. I'm interested in robotics, consumer hardware, cars, space, and embedded systems. I love leading teams and solving problems in creative ways.

## Updates

I am excited to announce that I will be joining the SpaceX Starlink team as an Engineering Intern in Redmond, WA for Summer 2024. After that, I will be completing my final year at the University of Notre Dame.
